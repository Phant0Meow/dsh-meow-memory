Cross-session memory for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH).

**The idea**: every workspace keeps a structured memory database (`.dsh-meow/memory.db`,
SQLite via `node:sqlite`). The static tool manual (seven layers + every `memory_*` tool's
usage) lives in the **system prompt** as a fixed section — constant text, so your LLM
provider's KV/context cache stays untouched. Dynamic content (soul/user in full, design
principles, memory guide) is injected as a **prefix of the first user message**, and the
first turn injects long-term memory only — no keyword hits. From the second user message
on, every message gets a keyword hit (top-2). The model deep-dives into the rest on demand
with `memory_search` / `memory_project`. Each window's own agent consolidates its memories
when idle ("dream") — memories it created plus ones it was shown — with the window's knowledge
frozen at the last conversation timestamp.

## ✨ Features

- **Seven memory layers** (`soul` = the AI itself / `user` = user basics & preferences /
  `project` = per-project info with `subcategory` (overview/structure/decisions/quotes/ops/todo) /
  `fact` = atomic facts / `lesson` = mistakes & corrections / `topic` = ongoing discussion arcs
  with a goal sentence / `rules` = design principles & behavioral rules). One SQLite table
  per layer, UUIDs are time-prefixed so id order == creation order.
- **First-turn injection (long-term memory block)**: before the first user message, a fixed
  format is injected: `===== 长期记忆 =====` → `【关于你】` (all soul entries) →
  `【关于user】` (all user entries) → `【设计原则】` (global rules with importance ≥ 2 —
  few, imperative guidelines) → `【记忆导引】` (usage note + the dynamic "all your projects"
  list for `memory_project`) → `===== 长期记忆结束 =====` + `本轮用户prompt：`.
  **No keyword hits on the first turn** (hits start from the second message). Even when the
  first user message arrives batched with a plugin notice (e.g. an approval-policy change
  notification), the snapshot still lands on the real user message and hits never fire early.
- **Per-message keyword hits**: from the second user message on, every real user message is
  matched against fact/lesson/rules/topic (scope = global + current-project anchor),
  top-2 hits are injected under a "可能相关的记忆，仅供参考：" prefix. Matching is based on
  **entry keywords** (LLM-extracted or auto bigram) — not full text, which is noisy.
  Scoring = intersection × idf × coverage × Ebbinghaus decay (by memory timestamp) ×
  importance weight × title bonus.
- **Current-project anchor**: any `memory_remember/search/update/project` call with a
  `project` parameter anchors the session's current project; unanchored sessions only hit
  global entries (casual chat stays unaffected).
- **Cache-friendly by design**: the static `meow-memory:guide` section (order 130, right
  after the `tool:*` guidance sections) is registered in the system prompt once — constant
  text, KV-cache friendly. Already-seen memories (`injected` + `searched`) are recorded per
  session (`.dsh-meow/sessions/<id>.json`): injection never repeats, and `memory_search`
  takes the top 5 by relevance unconditionally (seen / this-session memories included), then
  fills the rest from the ranking while skipping already-seen entries; a session-compaction
  signal (`compaction/*`) releases the seen records so compressed-away
  memories can be hit again.
- **Post-compaction re-injection**: after a session is compacted (manual `/compact` or
  automatic token-pressure compaction), the next user-message turn automatically re-injects
  the long-term memory snapshot plus the project overviews this session previously fetched
  via `memory_project` (rebuilt from the latest data) — the memory compacted away comes
  back within one turn, so the AI never suddenly goes amnesiac after compaction.
- **Toolset**: `memory_remember` (write, dedup merge, returns read-back confirmation:
  keywords/project; accepts a `keywords` parameter — reflection/dream turns have the LLM
  summarize 5–10 content words, auto bigram extraction as fallback) / `memory_search`
  (BM25 × recency, filters: level/project/status/days, default top10 = top 5 by relevance
  without excluding seen + 5 more skipping already-seen entries, sorted by memory timestamp) /
  `memory_project` (whole-project injection paragraph: **`project` parameter is required** — which project do you want? grouped by subcategory, all
  non-stale entries, todo section with latest 5 done + to-do list, plus memory-db &
  session-history pointers) / `memory_find_similar` (duplicate & conflict detection) /
  `memory_read` / `memory_update` (incl. status active/archived/stale, importance, goal,
  manual keyword fixes) / `memory_dream` (manual trigger; you can also just type the
  `/dream` command in the composer).
- **Memory timestamp** (`updated_at` = last update time): refreshed by dream stamping or
  any `memory_update`. Displayed timestamps are always `updated_at`; search (work view) shows
  relative time, hit-injection / memory_project (full-text view) show relative + absolute
  (e.g. "2026-08-15 10:58 [2 days ago]").
- **Project attribution**: global info gets `project: "全局"` (distinct from blank = unmarked);
  multi-project info uses comma-separated names (e.g. `"dsh, femwa"`) — search/hits match
  "contains current project name OR global".
- **Per-window dream**: a window becomes dream-eligible once idle ≥ `idleMinutes` (default
  **180 min = 3 hours**, replacing the old night window); every window whose last chat is
  newer than its last dream gets consolidated by its own main agent — round-based (atomic:
  project/fact/lesson/rules/soul/user, then topic, then a project-summary round whenever the
  window touched concrete projects — it re-checks each project via memory_project, distills
  concise long-term entries and archives the superseded ones), project sub-headings, memories
  it created plus ones it was shown (injected / searched / read via memory_read) — using its
  full conversation context; long-stable rules aren't re-reviewed every dream
  (`dream.rulesReviewDays`, default 2 days, keeps churn-y no-op updates away).
  **Peak-hour suppression**
  (in the configured `timeZone`, default Asia/Shanghai): no dream starts inside
  `suppressWindows` (default 09:00–12:00 & 14:00–18:00, API peak-tariff hours) nor within
  `suppressLeadMinutes` (default 15) before each window — it fires on the next check cycle
  after the peak ends; a dream already in progress is never interrupted. Old windows (no live
  agent, >24h) and archived sessions are left alone.
- **`/dream` command**: no need to wait for the idle trigger — type `/dream` in the composer
  to start consolidating this window's memories right away (same semantics as the
  `memory_dream` tool, immune to peak-hour suppression). Executed by the dsh command plane,
  never sent to the model; shows up in the `/` autocomplete menu. A consolidation already in
  progress is reported clearly instead of being started twice.
- **Skip dream consolidation (client)**: don't want a window's memories auto-consolidated?
  Open the "…" menu on its sidebar row and click **"跳过梦境整理记忆" (skip dream
  consolidation)**; click **"取消跳过梦境整理记忆" (un-skip)** to restore. Skipped windows are
  never picked up by the idle timer again, while `/dream` and `memory_dream` keep working,
  and their session row shows a **muted-gray "moon with slash" icon** at a glance. The skip
  flag persists across restarts and stays consistent across both instances (shared
  memory database).
- **Reflection**: after ≥7 consecutive tool steps within one task the plugin asks the
  model whether anything since the last consolidation is worth remembering. A turn whose
  last tool is a `memory_*` tool counts as already having consolidated (no re-reflection);
  cancelled turns never trigger it.
- **Injection-fold UI (client)**: first-turn long-term memory / per-message keyword hits
  collapse into a slim "injected memory" bar (same width as the user bubble) — click to see
  the full injected text; the user prompt shows as a bubble, keeping the flow clean.
  Only plain-text messages are folded (attachment-bearing ones stay untouched).
- **Reflection-fold UI (client)**: reflection/dream turns (prompt, think, tool calls and
  the report) collapse into a slim bar (collapsed by default, showing "N memories added" /
  "dream task"); clicking expands it into a card — Think / tool calls / context injections
  inside the card are expandable for details.
- **Session-list dream icon (client)**: sessions that have been dream-consolidated with no
  new conversation activity since show a **pale-yellow crescent-moon icon 🌙**; while a dream
  turn is running the moon **breathes white→gold** (replacing dsh's running-blue animation so
  it can't be mistaken for normal work); **skip-dreamed** sessions show a **muted-gray
  "moon with slash"** instead (un-skipping falls back to the crescent; priority: breathing >
  skipped > crescent); new activity removes the icon. The icon lives inside
  the dsh session row's status slot (replacing its content — no layout shift). Event-driven,
  no polling: the `/meow-memory/dream-events` SSE stream pushes `state:'dreaming'` when a
  dream starts, `state:'dreamed'` when it finishes, `state:'active'` when a session gets new
  activity, and `state:'skip'/'unskip'` when the skip flag flips; the client reconciles once
  against `/meow-memory/dreamed-sessions` and `/meow-memory/skip-dreams` on
  mount/reconnect. Row targeting needs zero dsh changes: it reads the React 18 fiber
  (`__reactFiber$` internal property) to get the row's render key = session id — no title
  matching.
- **Dream anti-repeat**: DB-atomic 60s check gate + atomic start claim (`dream_pending`) +
  interrupted-dream auto-recovery + orphan finalization (a finished dream turn always lands
  `last_dream_time`, even across hot-reload instances); plugin-turn events don't refresh
  window activity — an already-dreamed window is never re-dreamed.
- **Zero runtime dependencies**: `node:sqlite` (default-enabled on Node ≥22.13; 22.5–22.12 needs
  `--experimental-sqlite`) + self-contained esbuild bundle (`lib/index.js`). No native modules.

## 📦 Install

### Via npm (published package)

```sh
# 1. Install into the profile's node_modules (the loader resolves plugins there)
cd $DSH_HOME/profiles/web          # default home: ~/.dsh/profiles/web
npm install meow-memory

# 2. Add the package to the profile's assembly bundles in package.json (recommended since v0.9.0):
#    "dsh": { "profile": { "bundles": ["@deepseek-ai/dsh-base", "@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app", "meow-memory"] } }
#    (the package ships a dsh.bundle.patch; bundle assembly inserts it. Profile-patch
#     `insert` entries address existing ids — a new plugin not in the tree reports
#     "entry not found", so new plugins go through the bundles array.)

# 3. Restart dsh web. New sessions pick up the plugin automatically.
```

### By hand (any DSH install, no npm needed)

1. Copy (or symlink) this package into the profile's `node_modules`:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules
   ln -s /path/to/meow-memory ~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/meow-memory
   ```
   (On Windows: `New-Item -ItemType Junction ...` — NTFS junction, no admin needed.)
2. Add `meow-memory` to the profile `package.json`'s `dsh.profile.bundles` (same as above).
3. Restart `dsh web`. New sessions pick up the plugin automatically.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All fields are optional (profile patch or `cordis.patch.yml`):

```yaml
- id: meow-memory
  name: 'meow-memory'
  config:
    enabled: true          # master switch
    projectDir: '.dsh-meow' # memory directory, relative to the workspace
    promptLang: 'zh'       # ⚠️ set this on first use (see note below)
    hitTopK: 2             # max keyword-hit entries injected per user message (fact/lesson/rules/topic)
    reflect: true          # auto-reflection after ≥reflectTurns tool turns
    reflectTurns: 7        # consecutive tool turns before reflection triggers
    dream:
      enabled: true
      idleMinutes: 180      # window is dream-eligible after ≥180 min (3 h) idle
      suppressWindows:      # peak-hour suppression (computed in timeZone below, "HH:MM")
        - start: '09:00'    #   API peak-tariff hours
          end: '12:00'
        - start: '14:00'
          end: '18:00'
      suppressLeadMinutes: 15  # also suppressed for 15 min before each window
      checkMinutes: 15
      timeZone: 'Asia/Shanghai'  # the user's machine clock is US time; suppression
                                 # windows must follow this fixed zone instead
```

### promptLang: prompt & retrieval language (important)

`promptLang` decides two things: ① the language of injected/reflection/dream prompts; ② the language of tool descriptions. It also shapes the language the model writes memory entries in — keywords are extracted in the entry's language, so **go with your chat language**.

**Set it explicitly on first use**: `'zh'` (default) or `'en'` (built-in English language pack). If your chat language differs from your UI language, **go with your chat language**.

On the retrieval side: the BM25 tokenizer is language-independent since v0.20.0 (category routing) — a language mismatch between queries and stored entries no longer degrades recall; `en` additionally enables English normalization (stopword filter + Porter stemmer), so inflected queries still hit stored entries (`tokenizers` matches `tokenizer`).

Language packs are data files (one directory per language under `src/prompts/`, hot-read at runtime — no code changes needed). See [`src/prompts/README.md`](src/prompts/README.md) for the contributor guide and `npm run check-lang`. Instance-level overrides: drop same-named slot files into `<home>/.dsh-meow/prompts/<lang>/` (partial overrides welcome).

## 🛠 Development

```sh
npm install
npm run build          # esbuild bundle → lib/index.js (self-contained)
npm run test           # 228 logic tests: db / bm25 / migrate / inject / reflect / dream / tools / apply
```

The `@deepseek-ai/*` packages live in the dsh-meow pnpm workspace, not in this package's
`node_modules`. On Windows, `npm run link-workspace` (or `scripts/link-workspace.ps1`)
creates junction mirrors of the workspace packages so esbuild can resolve them;
`build.mjs` uses `nodePaths` to pick them up. The links are build-time only.
